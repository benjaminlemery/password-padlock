# Introduction

Password Padlock is an offline text based password manager. Password Padlock allows you to create randomly generated passwords that are secure. Once a password is created, it can later be retrieved by the user and to input that password into text fields the user can copy and paste the selected credentials into the text fields. This effectively allows you to create stronger, more secure passwords without having to type in long passwords.

​
# Encryption

Credentials are encrypted using a SHA-256 hash. Unique salt values are created for each individual user account.

​
# Supported Platforms

Password Padlock can be used on both Linux and  Windows.
